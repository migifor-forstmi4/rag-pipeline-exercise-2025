      "Question: What are the recommended considerations and monitoring protocols for further diuretic therapy in adults with resistant hypertension according to the 2019 guidelines?\n",
      "Answer A: According to the 2019 guidelines, for further diuretic therapy in adults with resistant hypertension, the following considerations and monitoring protocols are recommended:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Consider further diuretic therapy with low-dose spironolactone for adults with resistant hypertension starting step 4 treatment who have a blood potassium level of 4.5 mmol/l or less. Use caution in people with a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate due to increased risk of hyperkalaemia.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. When using further diuretic therapy for step 4 treatment of resistant hypertension, monitor blood sodium and potassium and renal function within 1 month of starting treatment and repeat as needed thereafter.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Consider an alpha-blocker or beta-blocker for adults with resistant hypertension starting step 4 treatment who have a blood potassium level of more than 4.5 mmol/l.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled in people with resistant hypertension taking the optimal tolerated doses of 4 drugs, seek specialist advice.\n",
      "Answer B: According to the 2019 guidelines, if hypertension is not controlled in adults taking the optimal tolerated doses of an ACE inhibitor or an ARB plus a CCB and a thiazide-like diuretic, they should be regarded as having resistant hypertension. Before considering further treatment for a person with resistant hypertension, it is important to confirm elevated clinic blood pressure measurements using ambulatory or home blood pressure recordings. For starting or changing diuretic treatment for hypertension, a thiazide-like diuretic, such as indapamide, should be offered in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide.\n",

      "Question: How does the NHS England's support for Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) and the recommendations for its use among individuals with hypertension address the challenges of white-coat effect and masked hypertension?\n",
      "Answer A: NHS England supports the use of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) through the blood pressure@home scheme to address the challenges of white-coat effect and masked hypertension. Recommendations suggest considering ABPM or HBPM in addition to clinic blood pressure measurements for people with hypertension who exhibit these effects, where clinic and non-clinic blood pressure results are conflicting. For those choosing to use HBPM, training and advice on using home monitors are provided, along with information on what to do if target blood pressure is not achieved. This approach acknowledges the need for accurate monitoring and offers a feasible alternative when clinic measurements may not reflect true blood pressure levels due to these effects.\n",
      "Answer B: NHS England supports the use of Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) through the blood pressure@home scheme, particularly for individuals with hypertension who may experience the white-coat effect or masked hypertension. The recommendations acknowledge that HBPM is a suitable alternative when Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) is unsuitable or not tolerated. The committee discussed the importance of patient choice, agreeing that home monitoring should be an option if it is suitable and the person is willing and motivated to use it. Furthermore, validated HBPM is recognized as an accurate method for diagnosing hypertension in people in sinus rhythm, which can help in addressing the challenges posed by the white-coat effect and masked hypertension.\n",

      "Answer A: I don't know.\n",
      "Answer B: The committee identified key considerations and gaps in evidence for the following patient populations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **People aged over 80**: There was no evidence specifically for this group; the only evidence was from mixed age groups, which the committee found too limited to support a new practice recommendation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **People with aortic aneurysm**: There was no evidence for this group.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **People who have had a stroke**: There was limited evidence that lower blood pressure targets reduced the risk of future strokes, but there was also evidence on the management of hypertension in adults without cardiovascular disease.\n",

      "Answer A: The new recommendations for the management of asthma in paediatric patients indicate that MART (maintenance and reliever therapy) is now the preferred step-up treatment for children whose asthma is not controlled on regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed. This introduction of MART is noted to be new, but it is not intended for children who are stable on their current therapy. It is expected to reduce asthma attacks and should not be disruptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, before escalating to a paediatric high-dose ICS regimen, an opinion should be sought from a specialist in asthma care. This highlights the importance of consultation with specialists when considering higher treatment levels, ensuring that appropriate management paths are taken for children with uncontrolled asthma. Overall, the changes are considered modest and cost-effective for the NHS.\n",
      "Answer B: The new recommendations suggest that MART (maintenance and reliever therapy) is the preferred step-up treatment for paediatric patients whose asthma is not controlled on regular paediatric low-dose ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) plus SABA (short-acting beta-agonists). However, it is emphasized that this recommendation is not intended for children who are stable on their current therapy, and the introduction of MART should not be disruptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before escalating to a paediatric high-dose ICS regimen, it is advised to seek an opinion from a specialist in asthma care. This ensures that the management of asthma is appropriate and that specialist guidance is available for potentially more complex treatment strategies.

      "Question: What are the key reasons for retaining Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) as the gold standard for hypertension diagnosis in primary care, and what challenges might be encountered in implementing these recommendations?\n",
      "Answer A: ABPM is retained as the gold standard for hypertension diagnosis in primary care due to its accurate measurement of blood pressure, its ability to identify white-coat and masked hypertension, and its cost-effectiveness compared to other methods. Challenges in implementing these recommendations include variation in practice, difficulties in accessing ABPM devices, and the need for changes in practice along with additional resources and training.\n",
      "Answer B: The key reasons for retaining Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) as the gold standard for hypertension diagnosis in primary care include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. ABPM remains the preferred method for the accurate measurement of blood pressure.\n",
      "2. Economic evidence indicated that ABPM is likely to be the most cost-effective method for diagnosis, even with new data for improved accuracy of home and clinic measurement.\n",
      "3. The evidence showed that validated Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) is an accurate method for diagnosing hypertension for people in sinus rhythm, but ABPM is still favored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges in implementing these recommendations include:\n",
      "1. Implementation of the 2011 recommendations on ABPM has been challenging.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) Variability**: Measure PEF twice daily for 2 weeks. Asthma can be diagnosed if PEF variability (expressed as amplitude percentage mean) is 20% or more.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **FeNO (Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide)**: If asthma is not confirmed by FeNO, BDR (Bronchodilator Reversibility), or PEF variability but is still suspected on clinical grounds, perform skin prick testing to house dust mite or measure total IgE level and blood eosinophil count.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Sensitization Evidence**: Exclude asthma if there is no evidence of sensitization to house dust mite on skin prick testing or if total serum IgE is not raised. Diagnose asthma if there is evidence of sensitization or a raised total IgE level and the eosinophil count is more than 0.5 x 10^9 per liter.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Referral for Specialist Opinion**: If there is still doubt about the diagnosis, refer to a pediatric specialist for a second opinion, which may include consideration of a bronchial challenge test.\n",
      "Answer B: The key diagnostic criteria and methods for confirming asthma in adults and children aged 5 to 16, as outlined by BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024, include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Objectiv e Tests**: \n",
      "   - For diagnosing asthma in children aged 5 to 16, objective tests should be conducted if there is a history suggestive of asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monitoring**: \n",
      "   - Asthma control should be monitored regularly to ensure effective management.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Specialist Referral**:\n",
      "   - If a child is unable to perform objective tests at age 5, tests should be attempted again every 6 to 12 months until satisfactory results are obtained, or they should be referred for specialist assessment if their asthma is not responding to treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Specialist Respiratory Assessment**:\n",
      "   - Any preschool child with an admission to hospital, or 2 or more admissions to an emergency department with wheeze in a 12-month period should be referred to a specialist respiratory paediatrician.\n",

      "Answer A: The key recommendations for diagnosing and treating hypertension as outlined in the guideline include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Measuring Blood Pressure**: Ensure healthcare professionals have adequate training for accurate blood pressure measurements, including palpating the pulse for irregularities before using automated devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lifestyle Advice**: Offer lifestyle advice to people with suspected or diagnosed hypertension, including dietary changes, exercise, and reducing alcohol and caffeine intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Antihypertensive Treatment**: For adults with uncontrolled blood pressure, antihypertensive drug treatment should be offered in line with recommendations. Specifically:\n",
      "   - Offer an ACE inhibitor or an ARB to adults starting step 1 antihypertensive treatment who have type 2 diabetes or are under 55 and not of Black African or African-Caribbean family origin.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consideration of Cardiovascular Disease**: There are specific recommendations for people with cardiovascular disease, such as following disease-specific guidelines for prescribing treatments, ensuring drug therapy aligns with established guidelines for conditions like myocardial infarction and heart failure.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Threshold for Treatment**: In older adults over 80, initiate treatment consistent with the treatment target of 150/90 mmHg or lower, using clinical judgment for those who are frail or have multiple comorbidities.\n",
      "\n",
      "These recommendations address both the need for accurate diagnosis and effective management of hypertension while considering the specific circumstances and risks faced by individuals with cardiovascular disease.\n",
      "Answer B: The key recommendations for diagnosing and treating hypertension address the importance of discussing the person's preferences for treatment and encouraging lifestyle changes. The decisions regarding starting drug treatment depend on individual preferences and their risk of cardiovascular disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "For individuals with cardiovascular disease, the guidelines emphasize that treatment decisions should consider the risks and benefits of each treatment option, allowing for an individualized approach to care. The recommendations provide a choice of possible treatment options and highlight that condition-specific recommendations (such as those for acute coronary syndromes and chronic heart failure) should be applied first when prescribing certain medications. \n",
