      "Answer A: If a patient with asthma does not achieve adequate control after an initial trial of medication, the following steps should be taken according to the recent NICE guidelines:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level if asthma is uncontrolled. A raised level may indicate poor adherence to treatment or the need for an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).\n",

      "2. Consider stepping up treatment, which may include:\n",
      "   - Offering a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler to be taken as needed for symptom relief (as-needed AIR therapy) for people aged 12 and over with newly diagnosed asthma.\n",
      "   - Starting treatment with low-dose maintenance and reliever therapy (MART) if the person is highly symptomatic or has a severe exacerbation, in addition to treating acute symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. After starting or adjusting medicines for asthma, review the response to treatment in 8 to 12 weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Consider increasing the dose of ICS if asthma control deteriorates, clearly outlining this in the patient's asthma action plan.\n",

      "Question: What are the key considerations and potential benefits outlined in the new asthma management recommendations for children regarding the use of moderate-dose ICS and MART, and how might they influence clinical practice?\n",
      "Answer A: The key considerations and potential benefits outlined in the new asthma management recommendations for children regarding the use of moderate-dose ICS and MART include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Preference for MART**: The recommendation for MART (maintenance and reliever therapy) as the preferred step-up treatment is new. It's intended for children whose asthma is uncontrolled on regular paediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed, provided they can manage the MART regimen.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Assessment of Ability**: For MART to be considered, children must be assessed to have the ability to manage the regimen, ensuring appropriate use.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Effectiveness in Reducing Attacks**: MART is expected to bring advantages in terms of reducing asthma attacks compared to current therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The changes are projected to be modest and cost-effective for the NHS.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Transitioning from Current Therapies**: The recommendations will likely result in more children being switched to MART rather than other treatment options, though the change should not be disruptive since MART is already in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Referral to Specialists**: If asthma control is not achieved on moderate-dose ICS (either as MART or regular ICS/LABA plus SABA), it is advised to seek an opinion from a specialist in asthma care.\n",
      "\n",
      "These recommendations may influence clinical practice by leading to an increased adoption of MART for suitable pediatric patients, enhancing asthma management through potentially better control of symptoms and reduction in exacerbations, while also emphasizing the need for careful patient assessment and monitoring.\n",
      "Answer B: The key considerations and potential benefits outlined in the new asthma management recommendations for children regarding the use of moderate-dose ICS and MART include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Recommendation for MART**: MART (Maintenance and Reliever Therapy) is recommended as the preferred step-up treatment, particularly for children whose asthma is not well controlled on current therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Safety and Stability**: The recommendation is not intended for children who are stable on their current therapy, ensuring that the introduction of MART should not be disruptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Reduction in Asthma Attacks**: The use of MART is expected to bring advantages in terms of reducing asthma attacks, thereby improving overall asthma management.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clinical Evidence Support**: Evidence suggests that MART is superior to both regular moderate-dose ICS plus SABA as needed and regular low-dose ICS/L ABA plus SABA as needed, as it reduces the number of exacerbations and hospital admissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: The economic analysis supports that MART is associated with fewer costs and more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to other treatment options, making it a cost-effective approach for the NHS.\n",
      "\n",
      "These recommendations may influence clinical practice by leading to more clinicians switching patients to MART rather than other treatment options, simplifying treatment regimens for those already using an ICS/formoterol inhaler, and providing a framework for escalating therapy in a structured manner when asthma is not adequately controlled.\n",

      "Question: What diagnostic testing approach did the committee recommend for ruling in asthma in children, and what factors influenced their decision regarding the use of FeNO and other tests?\n",
      "Answer A: The committee recommended a rule-in–rule-out approach for diagnosing asthma in children. They noted that testing for sensitisation to house dust mite via skin prick test or finding an elevated IgE showed high sensitivity, which influenced the decision. They found FeNO to be a more acceptable first test in children than eosinophil count because it avoids the need for blood withdrawal, and a level of 35 ppb or more is reasonably specific for asthma in the presence of a suggestive history. However, the committee acknowledged that not all children could perform the necessary expiratory maneuver for FeNO testing, and the availability of the equipment is not universal in primary care settings. Therefore, they agreed that BDR (bronchodilator reversibility) in spirometry could be used as a second test for those without an elevated FeNO, or as the first test if FeNO measurement was not possible.\n",
      "Answer B: The committee recommended a rule-in–rule-out diagnostic strategy for ruling in asthma in children. They suggested using FeNO as a more acceptable first test because it avoids the need to take blood, and a level of 35 ppb or more is reasonably specific for asthma in the presence of a suggestive history. However, factors influencing their decision included concerns that some children might not be able to have a FeNO test due to equipment availability in all primary care settings, inability to perform the necessary expiratory maneuver, and the increasing proportion of non-atopic children with asthma who are unlikely to have a raised FeNO level. Thus, they agreed to use spirometry with bronchodilator reversibility (BDR) as a second test for those without an elevated FeNO or as the first test in cases where FeNO could not be measured.\n",

      "Question: What factors should be considered when managing uncontrolled asthma before adjusting pharmacological treatments, and how might fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels assist in this process?\n",
      "Answer A: When managing uncontrolled asthma before adjusting pharmacological treatments, the following factors should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Check for raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, which may indicate poor adherence to treatment or the need for an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).\n",
      "2. Monitor the time off work or school due to asthma, the amount of reliever inhaler used, the number of courses of oral corticosteroids, and any hospital admissions or emergency department visits due to asthma symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "If FeNO levels are raised, it may suggest poor adherence to treatment or the necessity of increasing the ICS dosage.\n",
      "Answer B: When managing uncontrolled asthma before adjusting pharmacological treatments, the following factors should be considered:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels\n",
      "- Blood eosinophil count\n",
      "- Amount of reliever inhaler used\n",
      "- Number of courses of oral corticosteroids\n",
      "- Any admissions to hospital or attendance at an emergency department due to asthma\n",
      "- Psychosocial factors (for example, anxiety and depression, relationships and social networks)\n",
      "- Seasonal factors\n",
      "- Environmental factors (for example, air pollution, indoor mould exposure)\n",
      "\n",
      "FeNO levels can assist in this process by indicating airway inflammation. If FeNO is raised, it may suggest poor adherence to treatment or the need for an increased dose of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). Additionally, checking FeNO levels can help determine how to adjust treatment or indicate treatment adherence when symptoms are poorly controlled.\n",

Additionally, it refers to NICE's information on making decisions about care, highlighting that shared decision-making should be part of the healthcare process.\n",
